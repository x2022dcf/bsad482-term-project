# Reducing Youth Underemployment in Ontario
**Decision Intelligence Portfolio (BSAD 482) — Milestone 1**

## Decision Statement
Should the Ontario government prioritize funding for short-term skills training programs (micro-credentials, bootcamps, accelerated certificates) or traditional post-secondary education as a strategy to reduce youth underemployment over the next five years?


> [!WARNING]
> I looked for data to support this decision but most of it is is already tabulated in PDF reports, and very fragmented. Think this will be a hard question to answer without the data on short-term skills/microcredentials.  I added some links to your background that try to answer the question you've asked.

> [!TIP]
> Would you consider a pivot that investigates the employment success by degree program?   If you look here ,you can see data on employment successe - and could answer the question "I want a job, what program should I enroll in?" and potentially trend over time or show regional demand.  https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3710025101


## Executive Summary
Youth underemployment remains a significant challenge in Ontario’s labour market, particularly for young people attempting to transition from education into stable, well-matched employment. Many youth work in roles that do not fully utilize their skills or are unable to secure sufficient hours, which limits earnings, delays career development, and reduces long-term productivity. At the same time, employers report difficulty finding candidates with job-ready skills, creating inefficiencies for both workers and firms.

Ontario faces a real policy tradeoff in deciding how to allocate limited education and training funding. Short-term skills training programs such as micro-credentials, bootcamps, and accelerated certificates can be deployed quickly and aligned with immediate labour market needs. Traditional post-secondary education, while more time- and resource-intensive, often provides broader skill development and stronger long-term employment outcomes. Determining which pathway should be prioritized is not straightforward and depends on how effectively each approach reduces youth underemployment within a five-year time horizon.

This project frames the issue as a decision problem faced by Ontario policymakers and applies a systems-thinking perspective to examine how funding choices influence skills alignment, employment quality, and labour market dynamics. Using Statistics Canada labour force data and Ontario labour market reporting, the analysis aims to provide decision-relevant insights to support evidence-based education and workforce policy.

**Draft explanation:** The diagram highlights reinforcing and balancing feedback loops linking training capacity, job match quality, youth underemployment, and enrolment decisions. These loops illustrate how funding choices can improve employment outcomes while also creating potential saturation effects if program expansion outpaces labour market demand.
