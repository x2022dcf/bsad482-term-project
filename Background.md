# Background: Youth Underemployment in Ontario

## Why this decision matters (stakes)
Youth underemployment is a significant labour market challenge in Ontario, affecting both individual economic outcomes and broader provincial productivity. Many young people work in part-time, temporary, or lower-skill positions that do not fully utilize their education or skills, limiting income growth and delaying long-term career development. For Ontario, persistent youth underemployment represents a loss of human capital and can weaken the province’s ability to respond to evolving labour market demands. Employers simultaneously report difficulty finding job-ready candidates, suggesting inefficiencies in how education and training pathways align with workforce needs.

Recent labour market data show that youth are particularly vulnerable during periods of economic tightening, with higher unemployment and underemployment rates compared to prime-age workers. These outcomes have long-term consequences, as early-career job mismatch can negatively affect earnings trajectories, job stability, and labour force attachment. Addressing youth underemployment is therefore a policy priority not only for equity reasons, but also for sustaining Ontario’s economic competitiveness over time.

## What makes the decision difficult (tradeoffs)
Ontario faces a complex tradeoff when deciding how to allocate limited funding between short-term skills training and traditional post-secondary education. Short-term programs such as micro-credentials, bootcamps, and accelerated certificates can be designed quickly and aligned with immediate employer needs, potentially allowing young people to transition into employment faster. These programs are often less costly per participant and can be adjusted as labour market conditions change. However, concerns remain about the consistency, quality, and long-term value of some short-term credentials, as well as the risk of oversupplying specific occupations.

Traditional post-secondary education, including college diplomas and university degrees, tends to provide broader foundational skills and may support stronger long-term employment and earnings outcomes. However, these programs require greater public investment and take longer to complete, meaning they may be less responsive to short-term labour market shifts. The decision is therefore difficult because each option offers distinct benefits and risks across different time horizons, and prioritizing one may reduce resources available for the other.

## Key stakeholders
- **Youth and recent graduates:** employment quality, earnings, and long-term career opportunities.
- **Employers:** access to workers with relevant, job-ready skills.
- **Post-secondary institutions:** funding stability, program offerings, and accountability for graduate outcomes.
- **Training providers:** program demand, credibility, and alignment with labour market needs.
- **Ontario government and taxpayers:** efficient use of public funds and measurable labour market outcomes.

## Current approach / what has been tried
Ontario currently supports both traditional post-secondary education and short-term training pathways. In recent years, the province has promoted micro-credentials through colleges and universities and made many of these programs eligible for student financial assistance. This reflects an effort to increase flexibility within the education system and improve responsiveness to employer needs. At the same time, Ontario continues to make substantial investments in its post-secondary sector, which remains a primary pathway into the labour market for many young people.

Labour market research suggests that skills mismatches can impose significant economic costs when workers’ qualifications do not align with job requirements. As a result, policymakers increasingly emphasize alignment and employment outcomes when evaluating education and training investments. The challenge for Ontario is determining which combination of short-term and traditional pathways most effectively reduces youth underemployment within a five-year policy horizon.
